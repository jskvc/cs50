1.  Pneumono­ultra­microscopic­silico­volcano­coniosis  is the longest word in the English language  that refers to a lung diseaGGse.
2.  Getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the following:

        RUSAGE_SELF
    Return resource usage statistics for the calling process, which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the process.
        RUSAGE_CHILDREN
    Return resource usage statistics for all children of the calling process that have terminated and been waited for. 
    These statistics will include the resources used by grandchildren, and further removed descendants, if all of the 
    intervening descendants waited on their terminated children.
        RUSAGE_THREAD (since Linux 2.6.26)
    Return resource usage statistics for the calling thread.

4.  Passing in values involves copying the two 16 member struts which would take some time and memory. Since the purpose of 
    getrusage() is to track the resources required (including time and RAM) this would lead to inaccuracies. 
    Additionally, if a rusage struct has an undefined value it is autonatically set to zero. This negates any dereferencing 
    crashes or extra checks.
5.  Main is initialisation function of program.
6.  The const type ensures that the initial value of the parameter cannot be modified.
7.  First I used hash function to give hash values to word then I used hashtable to store hash values of dictionaty.
